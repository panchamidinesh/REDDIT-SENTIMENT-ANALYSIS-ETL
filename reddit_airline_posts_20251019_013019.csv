—Isaac enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942 at Fort Jackson in Columbia, S.C, and served in the Pacific Theater as a longshoreman in a labor battalion.  
 In February 1946, the decorated soldier received an honorable discharge at Camp Gordon, which is located near Augusta, Georgia.  
Along with other discharged soldiers, Woodard boarded a Greyhound bus on February 12 to travel home. A conflict was triggered when the white bus driver belittled the army veteran for asking to take a bathroom break.  
At the next stop, Woodard was met by the Chief Linwood Shull of the Batesburg, South Carolina police. While still in his army uniform, the police forcibly removed him from the bus and arrested him for disorderly conduct.  
They beat Woodward, and the next day he was convicted of 'drunken and disorderly conduct' and fined $50. 

They also refused to take him to hospital after beating him for several days.

 The beatings that he suffered while in police custody caused him Permanent Blindness.

Looking for comments, advice from people who have travelled this route in economy on whether the middle arm rests go up so we can lie down flat to sleep. I spoke to Cathay Pacific in HKG and they could not confirm or advise on this. I don't want to buy an extra seat to realize that they may have aircrafts that may be fitted with fixed arm rests.

  
Thanks for your comments!"

Salut, مرحبا! 😊 Random Brazilian (non-Lebanese) here. I tried to create a stable alternative Lebanon this last days, mixing reality and fiction, and creating a possible utopia. The lore is really big, so I will put the resume here. This post is just for fun, and I'm really sorry if someone feels offended by it. I swear that this is not my intention. Hope you enjoy !! Love from Brazil 🇧🇷 to Lebanon 🇱🇧 ❤️❤️❤️

République du Liban  الجمهورية اللبنانية

• Capital: Beirut • Official languages: Arabic and French • Population (2025): 5 millions • Official Religions: Christianism Maronite and Druze (Secularism de facto) • Political System: Semi-presidential republic • Currency: Lebanese Cedrus

Ethno-religious groups (2025):

 •Christians (65%) = Maronites (40%), Latin Catholics (8%) Greek Orthodox (7%), Greek Catholics (5%), Armenian Orthodox or Catholics (4%), Other Christians (1%). 

•Muslims (22%) = Sunni Muslims (10%), Shiite Muslims (12%) {46% of all Lebanese Muslims are Sufi}. 

•Druze (11%) 

•Irreligious and Others Religions (2%)

Languages (2025): Mother Tongue: • Arabic (57%) • French (32%) • Both Arabic and French (3%) • Others (8%) {Greek, Armenian, Syriac, Spanish, English, Portuguese}

Total Percentage of Speakers: • Arabic (97%) • French (92%) • English (25%) • Spanish (14%) • Greek (6%) • Armenian (4%) • Syriac (1%)

Facts that allowed stability and the success of this Lebanon (Resume):

1. Active Strict Mandatory Neutrality;
2. Secularism (de facto);
3. Integrative Nationalism (Anti-Sectarianism/Segregationism);
4. Anti-Extremism;
5. Anti-Foreign Interference;
6. Anti-Corruption;
7. Christian Majority;
8. Strong Neutral Diverse Military Army;
9. Beaumontism (Rachidism + Nourism) & PUL Hegemony;
10. Soft Federalism/Decentralization

Father Founder of Nation: Rachid Beaumont Hayek (First President of the independent state of Lebanon. Less authoritarian and more conciliatory ""Lebanese [Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk)"". Franco-Maronite Militar).

 • Ideology (Rachidism): Integrative Nationalism; Secularism de facto; Balanced Francophonie; Strict Diplomatic Neutrality; Education as a Foundation; Modernization; Pragmatic Economic Liberalism & Industrialization; Republicanism; Democracy; Rationalism; Strict Anti-Corruption and Charismatic Leadership.

Mother Founder of Nation: Noura al-Zahra Beaumont (Fisrt Vice-president  of the independent state of Lebanon. Rachid's wife. More conciliatory and cosmopolitan ""Lebanese [Evita Perón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Per%C3%B3n)"". Sufi Sunni famous actress and singer).

 • Ideology (Nourism): Social Humanism; Minority Advocacy; Working-class rights; Muslims rights; Support Arts/Culture; Sufism; Women's Rights; Cultural Diplomacy; Philanthropy; Charismatic Leadership; Pacifism; Moderated Feminism; Moderated Islam and Soft Pan-Arabism.

Parti de l'Union Libanaise (PUL) / حزب الاتحاد اللبناني (Lebanese Union Party) - Center-Right to Center-Left (Fractions: Right and Left) ""Catch-all"" party/Nationalism/Reformism/Political Syncretism/Beaumontism 

Absorbed many political parties (from various political spectrums), internal wings with real representation, form coalitions with other parties, and manage political rotation, avoiding political exclusion that would otherwise fuel violence. It maintains a strong public sector (education, health) and strict internal rules (transparency, quotas, zero tolerance for militias). It serves as an arbitrator/mediator.

Reasons that explain the hegemony of the PUL in the second half of the 20th century (Resume): 

● Popular devotion to the couple Rachid-Noura Beaumont

 ● Ideologically inclusive and conciliatory party 

● The real political inclusion of different ethno-religious groups

 ● The party's neutrality and the fear of external threats\* 

● The party's mandatory annual anti-corruption vetting system for all its political members\*\*

\*The politicians frequently warned the people about the real riches of major world powers and neighbors ""crushing"" Lebanon: a small, fragile, and regionally minority country (Christian-Druze in an exclusively Muslim region). On this context, PUL's stric neutrality benefits the party.

\*\*The party was the only one that subjected its politicians (and allies) to detailed investigations into their political and professional activities (carried out by government institutions and anti-corruption NGOs). Most politicians from other parties (mostly members of the Lebanese feudal-client elite) failed to be elected to high national office, as they were eventually denounced by the Lebanese Anti-Corruption Court. The public began to distrust the remaining parties. The Beaumonts used this as a political strategy."

1oa4lrt,overlanding,Super Pacific/Lone Peak vs RSI Sport and a Decked system.....,Legitimate_Truth_554,2025-10-19T00:47:19,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/overlanding/comments/1oa4lrt/super_pacificlone_peak_vs_rsi_sport_and_a_decked/,"Not sure how much we will really use this is my worry and cost difference between the options...we want to do more camping, take the dog with us etc but need to get a canopy for the truck either way.  We have a PSP with 30amps so we are set up for 12v success already and have a fridge. 

So debating between extremes a bit.  Spend 14kish money for a Super Pacific/lone peak set up with a heater, lights, stand up access, built in tent, security for goods etc built in. 

Other option is the RSI Sport (was going to go defender but want some windows for the dog and I see you can break into these quite easily with a shim/pry between rear lock and frame) so might as well get the windows on the Sport.  If I get the regular canopy I would get a decked system to be able to add a layer of protection to some items since the tailgate won't open without a key fob so they would really have to pry open the decked part.  So now to have this installed it's over 7k and no tent yet if one wanted to do a RT version.  

Really leaning toward paying more for the all in one solution even though it seems like a crazy amount.  I live in the PNW so theft is a real thing...but want to have something that works for camping/dispersed camping with the dog. 

Buy once cry once?  Standing up seems like its worth something but not sure how much :)

# Senior Manager, Enterprise Security Engineering
Apply To Job 
Job ID: 3275183
DoorDash, Inc.
United States - Remote
## **About the Role**
We are hiring a hands-on Senior Manager (L7) to lead our Enterprise Security Engineering function. This team builds the security guardrails—baselines, controls, and automated assurance—that make our enterprise secure by design. You will set vision and roadmaps, scale and mentor security engineering teams, and deliver security that is built-in, not bolted on. The work blends strategy and execution: design the playbook, coach leaders and senior engineers, and lean in directly when the stakes are high. Success in this role stems from a deep technical engineering understanding of the enterprise domain and effective cross-functional partnership and collaboration. You will work closely with IT service owners to embed guardrails into enterprise platforms and services, ensuring controls scale with reliability and business enablement. We prioritize crown-jewel systems and data through explicit risk tiering, focusing engineering efforts where they matter most.
## **You are excited about this opportunity because you will…**
  * **Define and deliver enterprise guardrails.** Ship and drive adoption of hardened baselines across identity, endpoints, SaaS, networks, and data; hold SLAs/SLOs and automated attestation for control health and adoption of Zero Trust primitives.
  * **Advance Zero Trust.** Enforce identity-aware access with continuous attestation for device/user signals, micro-segmentation, to adopt user- and machine-bound identities, and enable a hardened VPN-free environment. 
  * **Protect data in motion and at rest.** Define and scale data classification and context-aware DLP with least-privilege; enforce managed browsers for session isolation and data egress control; provide safe-by-default paths for AI and collaboration tools.
  * **Lead SaaS hardening, discovery, and control (with IT).** Establish a hardening baseline for sanctioned SaaS applications, continuously monitor for and identify shadow SaaS, and enforce a data-egress policy across the SaaS portfolio using modern, forward-thinking primitives.
  * **Scale architecture reviews.** Drive threat models, trust boundaries, and data-flow/abuse-case reviews; requiring assurance in code (e.g., tests, policy, mTLS/service identity, per-request authorization) for secure-by-default enterprise services.
  * **Engineer assurance-as-code.** Build policy engines and change gates for identity, device, SaaS, and network control planes; enforce posture and identity claims, detect drift, require signed configuration, and fail-safe on non-compliance.
  * **Oversee secrets hygiene.** Detect plaintext secrets in SaaS and on endpoints, block egress with managed browsers, route to approved vaulting, and verify KMS rotation and attestation signals.
  * **Review third-party and AI integrations.** Set pre-production minimums and clearly define exceptions that protect access boundaries and crown-jewel data.
  * **Strengthen the human edge.** Support phishing resilience, managed browsers adoption, and user-centric security controls that reduce risk without friction.
  * **Harden control gaps.** In partnership with Detection and Response, the Red Team, and Leadership, to implement corrective controls, close root causes, and prevent regressions through enforced tests and policy-as-code.
  * **Deliver measurable impact.** Define key control metrics and enterprise control health indicators, publish results, and drive improvements with accountable owners.


## **We are excited about you because you bring…**
  * **Leadership experience.** 10+ years in security or infrastructure; 5+ years managing. Player-coach who sets technical direction, mentors managers and senior engineers, and dives in on the hardest problems.
  * **Technical depth.** Foundation-first security—secure-by-default baselines, least privilege, segmentation, device and identity attestation, and telemetry-backed control health—applied with crown-jewel prioritization and pragmatic managed browsers use to reduce unsanctioned data egress without friction.
  * **Customer orientation.** Make the secure path the easy path by instrumenting adoption and time-to-task, reducing support tickets, and iterating guardrails for clarity and speed.
  * **Automation-first mindset.** Strong orientation toward policy-as-code, infrastructure-as-code, and automated assurance pipelines.
  * **Execution under pressure.** Demonstrated ability to make high-stakes calls with incomplete information and to sequence priorities against risk and business needs.
  * **Collaboration at scale.** History of building durable partnerships with IT, embedding controls into services without slowing delivery.
  * **Agile workflows.** Ability to hold, organize, and transparently manage multiple dynamic priorities to improve customer experience and velocity at scale.
  * **Influence and communication.** Able to align executives and engineers alike; trusted voice with cross-functional partners.
  * **Evidence of impact.** Record of defining metrics, publishing results, and driving measurable reductions in risk exposure.
  * **Credentials.** Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience required; advanced degree preferred.
  * **Reliability and flexibility.** Ability to support critical escalations outside standard hours; occasional travel, including international.


We expect this position to be filled by 12/16/25.

Honestly, much better than me ever winning.

The Axis held 7 out of 9 (Bucharest counts due to the inclusion of Romania) victory cities in Europe but Stalingrad was an inevitable future conquest whilst Leningrad was briefly in American hands but would be retaken soon. The Allies had limited options to recapture any of the key cities before the victory was comfirmed and my UK/Russian ally was despondent (a new player - kid's mildly overwhelmed grandfather) so we agreed to surrender.

Japan had also stalled the Americans well, weakened the British empire, wiped out China and was on the doorstep of Sydney. Whilst Pacific victory wasn't certain, a huge economy and some horrible Allied dice luck in this theatre had given the Japanese a decent measure of control.

After such a long time (10 turns, 15 hours across three weekend days) and with the Allies on the back foot in pretty much every area, I just wanted to congratulate my wife, commemorate her victory and show my gratitude for being lucky enough to have someone to play A&A with."

You may remember me from posts borderline accusing the entire field of ableism, culminating in switching my license into an inactive status a mere 6 months ago. Well I went back to school in another field, accounting, finished it, and am now looking for advice. The biggest issue with accounting is it seems nearly impossible to find anyone willing to give a fresh grad a chance (job). For all of my issues in SW at least I got to ""try"" a few jobs.

Another related issue is with finishing a new degree, I thought I would take the opportunity to relocate from Ohio to somewhere else I would feel more comfortable politically, ranging from the Pacific Northwest (WA/OR) or even abroad, such as Canada. I even made a post on r/AmerExit explaining my situation for the latter and despite my more recent degree and (kind of) work experience being accounting, almost all the comments I got said SW would far better help me in my relocating goals.

So my question now is a general ""WWYD?"" Should I bring my license back at all? Would I be able to relocate better with it? And perhaps my biggest question is are there any SW jobs that see my ""lived 2 lives/played both sides"" background of social work and business as an asset?"

We're a PMC that is mainly contracted by NATO/CIA/ & other various nations/groups. This is a newbie friendly, semi-realistic, semi-relaxed environment. We're focused and organized on mission, and pretty laid back outside of missions. We have an attendance based ranking system to keep operations running smoothly, voting for campaign settings/unit changes, and our own vehicle Pricing/Catalog system that can be used to purchase vehicles with mission funds.

We currently have around 20 active members and around 8-12 players consistently per OP and growing. Anyone is welcome, we have an experienced laid back crew who can show you the ropes if you're newer. Currently we rotate between custom Zeus Ops, Hearts & Mind's style Ops.

Players can currently join our AIRCOM wing for piloting & air crew, and Nebula-1 for ground operations.

Our current campaign runs persistent, 24/7. Plenty of side ops to do with your squad mates anytime.

Join us for our 3rd Anniversary Campaign! Last year, we were deployed to Vietnam to assist the Vietnamese Armed Forces\[VAF\] fight off an invasion by the PLA. This year, as we've shifted our mission lore into more of the official Arma-verse, we're going back to Vietnam for a brand new full-scale conflict to celebrate year 3 as a unit!

CSAT is a military and economic alliance that comprises of Eastern nations, serving as a direct counterpart to NATO. Recently formed at the apex of the Canton Protocol summits, this strategic alliance of states is built upon the goals of mutual defense, expanded global influence, and sustained economic growth.

After the conflict between the PLA & Vietnamese Armed Forces, a 30 x 30 mile wide DZ was established on the border's of Vietnam and Cambodia as a buffer. STAR has been contracted to recon the De-Militarized zone and investigate reports of an armed presence.

Just wanted to plug my KPDH fanfic here. I absolutely fell in love with the movie about a month or so ago, and inspiration to write came shortly after. 

I'm new to AO3, so I'm just trying to get my work out there some more :)

[https://archiveofourown.org/works/70729556/chapters/183849796](https://archiveofourown.org/works/70729556/chapters/183849796)

Some background on the fanfic, where it's going, etc.

\* Pre-canon/pre-debut. Explores how Huntrix met, relationship growth, character growth, worldbuilding, etc.

\* Healthy amount of angst and fluff.

\* I've created a semi-original villain (you'll see lol).

\* It's a *long* one (unfinished and uploading regularly).

\* After the pre-canon part is complete, I have plans for a post-canon part as well.

Overall, it's a canon-compliant extension of the universe where you can expect to just spend more time with the characters, watch them grow closer with one another, take care of each other, etc.

I've thankfully been able to stay ahead of my upload schedule, and I recently made a twitter where I'll be posting upload schedule updates (adexine\_AO3).

Here's a short excerpt from the end of Chapter 2:

*In the two weeks since then, her mom explained to Zoey that they were leaving Burbank to stay with her aunt in South Korea. She had to pack quickly. Her mom couldn't stay in that house for a moment longer.*

*Now she was here, on the roof where she had spent many of her evenings pouring her heart into notebook after notebook while listening to her music.*

*They were leaving tomorrow.*

*She took one last look at the familiar skyline: the rolling hills in the distance that protected Burbank from the Pacific weather, the light-green grass that would wither away in the summer, the palm trees scattered throughout the urban districts, all perhaps mundane things to most people, but now bitterly nostalgic to her. Isn't that funny... it was nostalgic, yet she never even had an opportunity to miss it.*

*But, of course, she had every opportunity to miss it.*

*Because it wasn't Burbank that she missed.*

*It was her dad.*

*The reality was that her dad left one day for New York City and took the seat at the dinner table, the king-sized bed, the bad TV-shows on Friday nights, her childhood memories, the rolling hills, the light green grass, and the palm trees with him.*

*He never came back.*

*Now she had to find them herself.*

Anyways, I sincerely hope you all enjoy! :)"

1oa3k9a,exmuslim,What do you think about islamic miracles?,Late-Bug-4439,2025-10-19T00:07:46,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1oa3k9a/what_do_you_think_about_islamic_miracles/,"See, Islam is pretty confusing to me because there are a ton of things that make sense and then there are a ton of things that don't.

Here are some things that (I think) don't make sense:

1. Islam out of all religions has the most brutal idea of punishment to those who don't obey. That is the first thing that doesn't make sense because it teaches you the idea of ""If you don't believe in god and do this and that then you're going to be tortured forever"". With that mindset it would mean that a serial killer could go to heaven if they repent and become a believer but someone who never did anything bad will go to hell just because they didn't believe. Someone tried to explain this to me by saying that the people who are the victims will recieve huge properties (as much as they wish) in their afterlife in order to forgive that bad person (in this example the serial killer). That's fair. But the person also said that not acknowledging someone is a big insult and that gives god the right to punish them forever. If the god is really that amazing and close to us then he would understand wouldn't he?
2. The system that Islam sets would work and it'd also be very peaceful if everyone actually participates. Picture a family with a woman taking care of the household, a man working, everyone being kind to each other, parents being good to their children and children being good to their parents, donating etc. The whole system would really work and make sense if you almost completely neglect your own wishes and desires. Like if you're gay/ want to be an independant woman/want to leave your toxic family/want to dress how you want or express yourself through fashion and a lot more. So as soon as you don't want to live like that it will become a burden to you. Some people praise it for teaching discipline but sometimes I think it would go to far.
3. In one hand god says that you have the free will to *choose* whatever you believe in and on the other hand he keeps repeating that he can guide whoever he wants. Which means he chooses to let some people be misguided. He could guide everyone or choose to not let unbelievers be born just to prevent them from going to hell but he still chose to create them. Doesn't that mean he *wants* them to go to hell?
4. The whole thing with testing us doesn't make much sense to me because there is no point in it. He knows everything and doesn't need anyone. I always thought that he might be bored to do it because I can't find any other reason
5. If it's really that clear and the truth then why do people who study religion a lot not all come to the same conclusion that Islam is the truth? Each one finds their own way in the end. People would not have to interpretend so much into things and we wouldn't have so many different scholars saying different things.

*(btw I'm sorry if I offend anyone with anything it's not my intention I just want to share my thoughts)*

And even though I just pinpointed all the things that I think don't make sense there are still all these ""miracles"". Now I know a lot of ex muslims say that these miracles aren't actual miracles and everything is based on the knowledge people already had back then but there are certain things that I don't think was common knowledge back then. (And please don't bring up the one with the sperms and backbone I know that one).

1. How could a man that wasn't able to read nor write come up with the quran which is a very well written?
2. How did he know that we will one day have cars (I think he said something like that one day people are going to have boxes that transport them) and that women will start wearing revealing clothes?
3. In the quran it says that they sent down iron meaning it wasnt from earth. Scientists have (not long ago) found out that iron is not from earth. It's in surah 57 thats the mass atomic number of iron.
4. The quran says that the universe is expanding which we now know is true.
5. The quran also talks about how two seas don't tresspass each other or get mixed. Like the pacific and atlantic oceans.
6. “We created man from a drop... then a clinging clot...” that's true.
7. The islamic lifestyle is very healthy. No alcohol/smoking/drugs, praying five times a day (the movements are healthy), drinking while sitting down, fasting etc
8. Why did they help slaves and tell others not to hurt other people (like killing etc.)
9. If Islam is made up then why would they come up with ramadan like what would it's purpous be in that case?
10. Since it's like a mysoginistic religion why would they put the names of mariam and muhammads wifes and put them on a pedelstal like that?

So yeah sorry for this long text but I really wanted to inclued all this. I'm really curious about your thoughts. I'll just repeat the question: **If you're an ex muslim what do you think of the islamic miracles?**"

I love to read, work on crafting projects (crochet, painting, learning to sew), or play games (The Sims 2 & 3, Crusader Kings, Fire Emblem, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and similar games). I am married so only interested in platonic relationships. I have 3 dogs who are my children lol. 

Hoping to find new people I have a real connection with. It's so hard to make new friends where I live because I hate going to bars and thats literally the only thing to do where I live."

**The Commonwealth is Dying. Will You Answer the Call?**

**(@LFG) (@LFP) (Custom Campaign) (Fallout: The Roleplaying Game 2d20 by Modiphius)**

The air in Vault 74 has changed. It's no longer just the familiar hum of the purifiers and the flickering of fluorescent lights. Now, there's a new sound: a dry, rattling cough echoing from the infirmary. A new sight: guards posted outside quarantined sectors. A new fear: the **Grim Dusk**, a plague that has slipped past the Vault Door and now stalks the corridors of your home.

Overseer Ruthren has chosen you. Your mission is to leave the steel-and-concrete safety you've always known and venture into the wasteland. Your destination is Andover, a settlement five days south, where a physician named Dr. Solaina Blackburn possibly has information on the source of the affliction.

This is **The Grim Dusk**, a custom campaign for the *Fallout: The Roleplaying Game*.

**What to Expect:**

* A desperate journey from the relative safety of Vault 74, through the rusted husks of the Corvega Assembly Plant, and into the dangerous heart of Old Boston.
* A gripping mystery centered on the origin of the Grim Dusk. Is it a pre-war horror, a FEV mutation, or something far more sinister?
* A mix of tense investigation, brutal wasteland survival, and classic *Fallout* combat.

**About the Game:** I'm a dedicated GM who has spent the last two years crafting and running this story, and I'm looking for **two more players** to complete a party of four.

Your character's story will begin inside Vault 74 as the crisis unfolds. Vault Dwellers are a natural fit, but any character who might have sought refuge or trade within the vault is welcome.

Ready to see if you're S.P.E.C.I.A.L. enough to save the Commonwealth? **Send me a DM** with a little about yourself, your time zone, any character ideas you're brewing, and your preferred style of roleplaying.

1. Heckin Trucks Tempe Talons at Red Rock Park

The idea here is that the Talons were in financial ruin and had to sell their souls to sponsors to keep the team afloat. Initially, these were real life companies (Home Depot, Heineken, Oscar Mayer, etc.) but at some point I realized it would be more fun to use the fictional sponsors in the game world. Thus we have the Talons at red Rock Park, where Heckin Trucks has a pickup dangling in centerfield. The last alternate is the special edition 2023 Gasconade XR jersey, which is the model of that truck in center if you were wondering.

All the sponsors on the jersey appear somewhere in Red Rock Park.

2. Yuba City Jurassics at Parque Jardineros

Pretty clear what I was going for here. Only thing to note is that I had to spell the team and city names here letter by letter in order to rotate them all slightly off-kilter to achieve this look.

3. Tacoma Alley Cats at Sakura Hills

Honestly not one of my favorites, but they can't all be winners. Never could find a theme I was happy with for a team to go in Sakura Hills...

4. Montana Mountain Men at Big Sky Park (shared w/ Boise Pilots)

A simplistic hat/ jersey logo here, but one I really like. I also went a bit deeper into the bag on the main team logo and the alt jersey that's a straight up landscape scene lol.

5. Boise Pilots at Big Sky Park (shared w/ Montana Mountain Men)

Obviously the Pilots make sense here given there are actually planes taking off in the background of this ballpark. This P logo was inspired by a post I saw on here, and I put together the B with the wing on it later on int he process. Bit of a shoutout to the Mariners color scheme for this Pacific Northwest club."

\- If MTV beats SLT and BME beats KING, its a three-way draw that gets broken by the face-to-face round diff (I'm assuming its the total round diff against the other two teams).

\- SLT can guarantee an upper bracket by losing by less than 12 rounds

\- BME can destroy KING but still not make it to UBs if MTV destroys SLT

\- MTV *have to win* to get a chance to go to UBs, and even then it depends on BME losing to E-KING to lock it.

An easy, delicious, and super impressive dessert. 

**Ingredients:**

1 1⁄2 cup Whole Milk (Cold; Divided use)

2 1⁄4 tsp Unflavored Gelatin

1 1⁄2 cup Cream

1⁄3 cup Sugar

pinch Pacific Flake Sea Salt

1 tsp Vanilla Extract

Healthy pinch Saffron Threads (about 1/4 gram)

5 Cardamom Pods (Slightly crushed)

Garnish Ingredients:

Whipped Cream

Rose Petals

Chopped Pistachios

**Directions:**

In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of milk with the unflavored gelatin. Set aside. When the top of the milk looks like a brain, stir. Let it continue to sit until needed.

In a medium saucepan, combine ½ cup milk, 1 ½ cup cream, ⅓ cup sugar, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, saffron threads, and cardamom pods.

Heat over medium-low heat. Stir often to dissolve the sugar. Heat until the mixture just barely comes to a simmer or small bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Remove from the heat.

Cover the pan with a lid or a plate. Allow to sit and infuse for 15 minutes. 

Place the saucepan back on the stove over low heat. Add the milk and gelatin mixture into the saucepan with the cream mixture. Whisk until smooth. Make sure the mixture is completely smooth and that there are no little crystals of gelatin remaining. Once the gelatin is added, do not allow the mixture to come to a boil as this will kill the gelatin.

Pour your panna cotta mixture into individual ramekins, jars, or glasses. Place in the refrigerator to set for a minimum of 4 hours.

When serving, garnish with whipped cream, rose petals, and pistachios"

The way I understood it, the bulleted values are the *breakdown of the 20.4%*. Am I wrong? Because they do not sum up to 100%.

My dealbreaker filter is age 18–31, and everything else is left wide open. I mostly comment on East, Southeast, or Pacific Islander profiles (I admit I have a type 😅). I only swipe on profiles that show some effort — not high standards, just not blank ones.

As for my photos, I’ll admit they don’t reflect much effort (which is true).

The car shot is a half-candid that I like because it shows my road-tripping/outdoors side and gives a sense of height.

The selfie with books was taken the night I decided to make a Hinge — the only one I took for dating purposes.

The other two selfies are haircut reference photos.

1oa23tq,movies,The Final Countdown Needs a Remake,theoxfordtailor,2025-10-18T23:11:43,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oa23tq/the_final_countdown_needs_a_remake/,"Hear me out. I normally absolutely hate even the thought of a remake, but I think 1980's The Final Countdown might be an exception. 

If you're not familiar, The Final Countdown is a 1980 movie where a US aircraft carrier in the Pacific goes back in time to December 6th, 1941. They realize they have the ability to stop Pearl Harbor from happening and could wipe out the Japanese fleet. The crew wrestles with the ramifications of doing so.

Spoilers from here on out.

Why a remake? For starters, there is practically nothing memorable about this movie that a remake couldn't preserve. The performances are nothing to speak of and the script is dull. 

Secondly, the movie ultimately fails to deliver on its promise. It builds up to a big battle between the modern US Navy and WW2 Imperial Japan, but they deus ex machina'd right out of it. 

Now, imagine a remake with modern special effects. You could have a version of The Final Countdown that preserves the premise but also delivers on the promised payoff. 

Then imagine the ending where the carrier goes back to the present and Pearl Harbor never happened. They get to see the consequences for having intervened in history. Suddenly the what-if scenario carries much more weight. 

What do you think? Are there any other movies that could do with a remake?"

# The Unseen Psychology Behind Combat Sports Preparation

What separates elite fighters from everyone else isn't just skill—it's their relationship with their gear. When you step into the cage or onto the mats, your equipment becomes an extension of your body, your mindset, and your fighting philosophy. This psychological advantage begins with understanding that **every piece of gear serves dual purposes**: physical protection and mental fortification. The confidence that comes from knowing you're properly equipped allows you to focus completely on technique, strategy, and performance.

The global combat sports equipment market is experiencing unprecedented growth, projected to reach **$12.46 billion by 2029** with a compound annual growth rate of 6.9%. This expansion is fueled by MMA's evolution from a niche combat sport to a mainstream fitness discipline, with major organizations like UFC Gym targeting 150+ locations globally and projecting $7 million in annual revenue from structured training programs. For practitioners worldwide, this means more innovation and specialized equipment options than ever before.

# The Essential MMA Fight Gear Checklist: From Beginner to Pro

# Core Protection: Your First Line of Defense

# Hand Protection Ecosystem

* **MMA Gloves**: The most fundamental piece of equipment, commanding 38.42% of the market share in 2024. Unlike traditional boxing gloves, MMA gloves are designed with open fingers for grappling while providing adequate padding for striking. Different types serve specific purposes:
* **Competition Gloves** (4-6 ounces): Minimal padding for maximum mobility during actual fights.
* **Training Gloves** (6-8 ounces): Enhanced padding to protect hands during repetitive training sessions.
* **Bag Gloves**: Specifically designed to prevent wrist issues during heavy bag work.
* **Hand Wraps**: These provide critical support for your wrists, knuckles, and thumb joints—areas vulnerable to impact injuries. Traditional cotton wraps offer customizable support, while newer hybrid gel/foam options like Hayabusa's Quick Hand Gel Wraps provide convenience and consistent protection.

# Head and Oral Protection

* **Mouthguards**: A non-negotiable safety item that not only protects your teeth but also significantly reduces concussion risk by absorbing impact that would otherwise travel to the brain. Custom-fitted mouthguards offer superior protection and comfort compared to generic ""boil-and-bite"" options.
* **Headgear**: While not always used in professional competition, headgear is essential for sparring sessions. Modern designs prioritize **peripheral vision** and **ventilation** while protecting against facial cuts, cauliflower ear, and reducing impact to the head.

# Comprehensive Body Protection

* **Shin Guards**: The fastest-growing segment in MMA equipment with a projected CAGR of 5.06% through 2030. These protect both you and your training partners during kicking drills and sparring. Look for models with **dense foam padding** that wraps around the shin while allowing ankle mobility.
* **Groin Protectors**: Often overlooked by beginners but absolutely essential for all combat sports training, protecting against accidental low blows during fast-paced sessions.
* **Rash Guards**: These technical shirts do more than just look good—they protect against mat burns, reduce the risk of skin infections, and wick sweat away from your body to keep you cool and comfortable. The compression fit also provides light muscle support.

# Specialized Training Equipment for Fight Development

# Striking Development Tools

# Combat Sports Gear Industry Insights: Trends and Market Intelligence

# Demographic Shifts and Market Evolution

The combat sports landscape is undergoing significant demographic changes that every serious practitioner should understand:

* **Female participation** represents the fastest-growing segment in MMA, accelerating at a 5.23% CAGR through 2030\[cite:9\]. This has spurred demand for female-specific gear and apparel designed for different body types.
* **Youth and family programs** now account for 40% of martial arts participants, with many families enrolling together.
* **Geographical expansion** continues with North America dominating the market, but Asia-Pacific showing significant growth potential, particularly in markets like India with its rapidly expanding e-commerce sector projected to reach $136.47 billion by 2026.

# Technological Innovations Reshaping Equipment

The integration of technology into combat sports equipment represents the most significant evolution in recent years:

* **Smart Equipment**: UFC's 2024 glove redesign features VICIS RFLX foam technology and VeChain blockchain authentication, enhancing both performance and product authenticity.
* **Biometric Monitoring**: Advanced mouthguards like those from OPRO now incorporate head-impact monitoring alongside traditional protective functions.
* **Performance Analytics**: Tools like FightCamp's sensor-equipped heavy bags monitor punch counts and deliver real-time performance insights, with backing from high-profile investors like Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather.

# The Psychological Edge: How Your Gear Impacts Performance

Beyond physical protection, your equipment provides tangible psychological advantages that impact performance:

# The Ritual of Preparation

The process of wrapping hands, lacing gloves, and putting on protective gear creates a **mental trigger** that signals transition from everyday life to training mindset. This ritualistic aspect helps fighters achieve optimal focus before sessions.

# Confidence Through Protection

Knowing you have adequate protection allows you to train with greater intensity and focus on technique rather than fear of injury. This is particularly important in sparring sessions where confidence directly impacts performance.

# Identity and Professionalism

Your gear represents your commitment to the craft. High-quality, well-maintained equipment not only functions better but also reinforces your identity as a serious practitioner, influencing how training partners and opponents perceive you.

# The Future of Combat Sports Equipment: Emerging Trends

Looking ahead, several key developments will shape the next generation of MMA and combat sports gear:

* **Youth-Specific Innovation**: As younger participation grows, age-appropriate equipment with adjustable features for growing athletes.
* **Regulatory Standardization**: Increasingly unified equipment standards across athletic commissions influencing manufacturing specifications.

# Conclusion: Your Path to Proper Equipment Selection

The journey toward optimal gear selection balances safety, performance, and personal preference. Begin with **essential protection**—quality gloves, mouthguard, and head protection—then progressively expand your collection as your training intensifies and specializes. Remember that **proper equipment maintenance** is as crucial as the initial selection; well-maintained gear lasts longer and provides more consistent protection.

The right equipment should become invisible during training—not in the sense that you don't notice it, but that it functions so seamlessly with your movements that it feels like a natural extension of your body. This symbiotic relationship between fighter and gear represents the ultimate goal of combat sports equipment design and selection.

1oa1vw1,CheetahSide,My lore for Dewey and Bishop and also their world.,Salty-Reference7651,2025-10-18T23:02:57,3,0,https://i.redd.it/hii8pnxcowvf1.jpeg,"OK I used to have a lore wrote out for them but to my old account was deleted. So here's their lore again.

Bishop Walker (code name Treeman) is a member of a group called Crypted Hunter a organization that main job is to hunter and capture cryptids to protect the world. Bishop trained his way to become a one of the best at his job. Although he is still merely a Officer he is not one of the highest members which is a commander. He primarily specializes in a stealth and long range combat with some hand to hand on the side. Here where's a suit that is mentor to mimic a smaller trees which helps him blend in and makes it so cryptid's who contracts and have a hard time getting him. He has a modified shotgun that has a longer Range to it but not as powerful. But he can make up for this with his special ability. Bishop is a known as a spellbinder which are people who have the ability to give things power by writing glyphs on various objects and creatures. He has a glyph that is able to put pure power into a object at the risk of destroying it due to the mass amount of power. Of course he has no problem with this as he simply puts the glyph on his ammo box it empowers the bullets inside the box so when he fires it they shoot out with massive amounts of force being able to shred more than a typical bullet can. Although his ammo boxer will sometimes, Put it although this is a better alternative than marking each of the bullets with the symbol as the more durable the object the longer they can last. Plus he actually has to carve the symbol on it and doing that for every single bullet would get very tiring. He's a very quieter man that can come off as being too serious or even rude to a lot of people. Here's a kind person but he takes his job very seriously. He not only thinks that cryptids are dangerous for people but also to the environment seeing them as abominations to the natural order. He loves nature especially the various plants. He also likes more vegetarian options and has a liking for bitter foods. He does not like alcohol he mostly drinks tea which is how him and Dewey managed to get along despite their differences.

Dewey Sherbet (code name Wildman) Is also a member of the crypted hunters and is a junior officer the rank below officer. Dewey is a Cursed One A group of people who are born with various powers at birth that often times mutate or change their bodies to look more monstrous. Oftentimes these powers will be a more flexible and vary than with a spellbinders, Along with needing no symbols to write. They oftentimes are more physically stronger than spellbinders. Although one can also be a cursed one while also being a spellbinder. Although cursed ones are often treated worst and are not technically accepted into society and are basically forced to either be hunted like encrypted or join the crypted hunters. When Dewey was young There was nothing strange about him until his curse came into effect he started growing a bigger and had a lot more hair. Well at first this seems like an advantage his appearance made him look like a common type of crypted a Sasquatch. This caused the village and his own parents to chase him out in fear of him. He survived mostly in the wild forging and killing animals to survive. Until he was eventually captured by the crypted hunters. They realized he was not a Sasquatch due to his more human like face, So they got to training and teaching him to become a crypted hunter. Here is very powerful not just physically but also due to his unique power. Here can transform his fur Into any kind of the 4 states of matter. Solid liquid gasses and plasma. This allows him to be versatile with a lot of his abilities and fighting. He can even absorb similar elements into his transformed fur to make it even bigger like Having his fur in a water state go into a puddle and absorbing the water to become bigger. Due to his good behavior and kind attitude he was able to become a junior officer surprisingly quickly, Although this was to the dismay of a bishop who did not really connect with the Dewey at first due to his more louder and talkative attitude. Although they quickly gained a respecter for one another on and off of the field. They are greater as a team complementing each other very well. Although not everything is fine with Dewey. He still has this urge from when he was out in the woods for so long, This primordial animalistic urge to hunt and kill to become a beast, He pushes this urge all the way down he does not want to become the monster everyone always saw him as. He's not going to be good because of his powers. He is going to be good despite his powers.

Anyways for the extra lore that I could not fit in. So how did this world come to be? Well there are two planets in two different universes. One was more closer in resemblance to Earth but the more old West style with its technology and culture. The other was a brighter luscious planet with a forest and oceans but also skies that looked like an aurora borealis and a massive crystals that littered the land growing high as mountains or even growing on mountains, Looking like a coral reef. On this earth people lived in harmony with the world and its various unique creatures. Despite these people having various different cultures they were all connected so they were commonly referred to as the Mcclon and the beast who inhabited these lands were known as the Accoun. There was something interesting about the various crystals that scattered their land. they had this power innate to them. None of the Mcclon or Accoun bothered to take their power and simply built their homes around them seeing them as sanctuaries. But these crystals had a unique energy that could sometimes riff the hole between these two dimensions. Enough of these happened that a small group of the government saw these portals. They could not travel through these portals due to their small size and the fact that they would quickly blink out of existence. But they were so interested in these that they started collecting them. After collecting a few of these and also losing a few arms due to the portals suddenly closing, They were able to gain enough of them to test their abilities. They figured that with enough of them they could make a more stable riff that they would be able to travel through. Using Had their technology they managed to build a device using these crystals to try and travel to this dimension. But something went wrong and instead of creating a stable portal a massive calamity occurred that both destroyed the second world and Brought multiple of the Mcclon and Accoun's to theirs. Now this was not the plan you see something else tampered with this a being older than time older than existence a elder God who wanted to destroy everything in return everything back to the silence that it's so wanted. Because of the mass of crystals that were being used for the machine the God was able to tamper with it causing the calamity. It did this because for many years it tried to destroy everything thing would but the various Accoun's always stop them from being able to materialize in a their plane of existence which would destroy everything. But now with their species home gone and them divided he could now start his plans. Also I didn't mention this because I had no way to put this cryptids are busted as all get out. Like they work on werewolf logic which is basically unless you have this one thing they are basically unkillable. Which is surprisingly not an accurate if you read a lot of cryptid legends. So yeah that's how they're able to fend off an elder god. Anyway but anyways after the calamity the Accoun and Mcclon were scattered some of them even being lost and the calamity, Having their essences being ripped apart and spread around. The Mcclon that got caught in this would become spirit vengeful and would attack or haunt in the human from this world. While the Accoun ended up having their powers being filtered into various individuals giving them powers similar to what they have. Why this is how we get curse ones. The ones who did were scattered but one thing was clear to the Accoun this Earth was to blame. A lot of the Accoun had powers that could smell a sort of scent a aura around people that can tell them various things. And one thing was clear these were not their people and they reeked of a sin that not even a their people were where. Mini Accoun attacked the people of this earth whether it be a blaming them for what happened or out of a mindless blood loss for revenge. Not all of them did but a lot of them went and collected each other into groups swearing revenge to take down their government and make them pay for destroying their home and for a torturing their people. Oh I forgot that you see the Mcclon were technically a lot easier for them to integrate into their society being the fact that they looked just like humans. But the government of the nation that did the experiment notice that these people were not like others having different memories and different languages to them. So they began to collect these people and get information out of them. The detail of course after managing to communicate with them and also some of the Accoun's they realize What they did and to make sure that it never got out to the public they began to issue arrest warrants and even bounties for the Mcclon to make sure that they would not pay for their crime. I should also make this clear this was the action of one nation there are multiple nations on this earth and most of them are not aware of this. This is mostly because Of this government basically running a giant propaganda campaign as well as being more friendly and willing to do trade with these other countries in exchange for helping them with their crypted problems. Although there are some countries that are more in the loop than others some that realize that something isn't right and there have been small organizations that have been trying to stop this government. Even working with the Accoun and Mcclon. Oh also the Accoun and the Mcclon got new names eh that were given eh by the people of this earth the Accoun were called cryptids and the Mcclon were called Pestilent bringers. Pestilent bringers in Pacifically were branded as mostly people with a disease that needed to be contained and capture which is what the government says to explain why they were hunting these people down. Although they also tinted to use other methods like That tended to a leader to a racial stereotypes of these plague Bringers that unfortunately tended to spread to the rest of the various races that lived on this earth. A government using Racism to justify killing and containing people man I wonder what that's like? But besides the timely political commentary. The elder God got what he wanted A lot of the cryptids were now focused on the people of this planet and not him and even a lot of the more powerful ones were in this sort of coma having their giant bodies being laid underground or deep in the oceans. He could now slowly bring his presence into this world by Giving people these visions of the symbols that when are drawn give power. Smaller slowly more and more people he would give this power to eventually in fact the entire planet and be able to bring him to their world. This is the origin of the spellbinders.

So yeah that was a lot there's probably some spelling errors in there but either way I hope you enjoyed this massive amount of lore."

1oa1rvy,dividends,The must reads in an annual report and how I leverage AI to save me time,Own-Release-1895,2025-10-18T22:58:36,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oa1rvy,"What I notice when I was reading an annual report, I am looking at similar sections of the annual reports

In my opinion, these are the must reads of an annual report

1. Business, to determine the product line, industry they are in, MD&A, management style/tone, competitors and competitive advantages
2. Find out the vision of the company, and extrapolate how it will impact our current world, for the good or bad. For example, nvidia, ai will be the game changer in the next few years. Business will incorporate ai to make business workflows more efficient (calls, customer service, email, etc), users to gain knowledge, etc. Vision is essential!
3. Financial statement, primarily income statement. You can see the revenue, expense and profit trends. And whats eating profits up year to year. What assets they are utilising investing from the revenue, whether its R&D or machineries, etc. Read the unusual changes in this section. When profits drop by 50 percent, know what made this happen. Then we have the cash flow (what goes in and out of the business) and the balance sheet
4. Risk factors. What is stopping/causing the company from reaching their vision. For example, drastic increase in competition, regulation, supply expense, or the economy

I usually try to use chatGPT or perplexity to summarise all these information, but I have to repeatedly prompt them these sections everytime, so I use [ReportInsightsAI ](https://aireportinsights.org/)to help me. Surprisingly, it gives me all the information above, and allows me to chat with the annual report to ask questions about it so saves me tons of time but of course, I use it as an assistant instead of fully relying on it but still a game changer for me!

What do you usually look for in an annual report?"

With them came an envelope citing the Peter Binford Foundation/Metropolitan Printing Co of Portland, OR. Through some digging they seem to be the plates used to create Leslie Haskins' 1932 book ""Wild Flowers of the Pacific Coast"". They are all 4x6, copper, and mounted on 1"" thick hardwood. I have 57 of them. They are all stamped ""I.P.E.U"" on the wood (International Photoengravers Union of North America). Im struggling to find anything remotely similar online, at least by subject matter and time period (likely 20s, maybe early 30s), so any information would be greatly appreciated. :)"

1oa1axz,UniversalEpicUniverse,Our Epic Universe Experience,Belpeppah,2025-10-18T22:39:42,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalEpicUniverse/comments/1oa1axz/our_epic_universe_experience/,"We just got back from our trip which included one day at Epic Universe- here’s what happened, final thoughts/things I think would be helpful to know:

We stayed at Portofino and had the 3 day park-to-park plus 1 day epic universe tickets. Family of 4, my husband and I, my younger sister (all in our 20s) and our 7 y/o little brother. We flew in Monday, did a half park day at studios, and chose Tuesday as our Epic Universe day. 

We did not purchase express passes, as they were quoted to us at about $1,100, and by the time we had second thoughts (a few days before we left) the date was sold out. 

We were not on the first bus, I would say we got on the bus around 7:50-8:15. We were in line for the park for about 15 minutes, they let us in a little earlier than early park admission and we walked through the gates at about 8:55.  Walked straight back to the ministry of magic portal, and got in line for Battle at the Ministry. The queue was outside the wand shop/up the street to the right of the circus tent. Posted wait time was 105 minutes. We ended up waiting about three hours. I would say this was our only mistake, as the ride was great! (Probably the most realistic humanoid animatronics I have seen from universal) but definitely not worth spending 25% of our total allotted park time there. As a childhood Harry Potter fan, who has been to the park for every opening of a new HP area, I was more impressed and immersed by the ministry section as a whole, and probably could’ve skipped the ride and saved us three hours.

After BaTM, we purchased a wand for my little brother, and he loved doing the magic! They were sold out of a few of the ones he wanted, which is fine, and he ultimately still got one he really liked. 

We then headed over to Nintendo land, and LOVED everything about the area as soon as we stepped through the portal. It was super crowded, but we were still so immersed and honestly it did not take away from the alive feeling of the area! Crowds in HP areas make you feel claustrophobic, but the Nintendo zone benefitted from the chatter and sound effects from people with power bands. 

We got in line for minecart madness, wait time was posted at 155 mins. The queue was fun, with a very cool Kranky Kong animatronic, and the music was bumping! We ended up off the ride about an hour after getting in line, so that was a nice surprise. Everybody loved the ride! 

We got in line for the toadstool cafe after that, which did take a while, I’m pretty sure the total time from getting in line for Minecart Madness until we sat down in the cafe (waiting for food) was exactly 2.5 hours. The immersion was on point and sitting in the cafe was very fun, and the food was…ok. I don’t feel like it was a waste to go there, but if you’re not super into Mario like my younger sister (the third adult), it could probably be skipped. The staff were friendly and very efficient. 

After this we got in the line for stardust racers, which moved very quickly! IIRC, it was about 20 minutes. 7 y/o was not a fan of this one, even though he met the height requirements, in general I think he was still a bit too small for the thrill rides, and didn’t enjoy how the lap bars felt against his lap/lower ribs. I want to emphasize here: he was safe, just uncomfortable, though he did say the SR was worse than the velocicoaster seat, which he rode the next day. That was a little spooky given the circumstances, but the adults all enjoyed the ride. (7 y/o was not aware of the SR incident, but parents were informed and we had a very detailed discussion over whether they were comfortable with letting him ride). 

From here we headed to the Dark Universe, and got in line for Monsters Unchained. I can’t honestly remember how long we were in the line, I would say we probably spent 20 minutes in the outside part of the queue, and maybe another 20-30 inside? There were ceiling fans on the outside bit and the inside portion was FULL of cool Easter eggs and details that the literature nerds of the group were completely nuts for. Honestly this was the best queue in the park, way out-classing (for us) the BatM. This ride was a favorite among our group, with amazing animatronics and so many cool details, including (I was unaware until my husband told me) lots of references to the Van Helsing movie with Hugh Jackman. So that was pretty cool! I think it was about 4:00 at this point, and I made us a reservation for 8:30 dinner at the Blue Dragon, as it didn’t seem like there were any offerings for sit down restaurants that weren’t full service, and we didn’t really want to do quick service for dinner.  

After that we headed to Isle of Berk for some macaroni cones, and enjoyed some of the cool theming and animatronics in the area. We were going to do Fyre drill, but it shut down as we were finishing up our snacks. After SR, 7y/o was a little hesitant to ride more real coasters, so we decided to split up, 7y/o and I went back to ministry of magic and did all the spells, while the other two rode SR again. We all walked around a bit, we didn’t really have time for another ride, the only one everyone would’ve wanted to go on was mariokart, which was still around 115 minute wait, and all the way across the park.

We headed to dinner at the Blue Dragon, which was excellent, but did not have a lot of offerings for picky eater kids. This is one thing we noticed about several of the full service restaurants, not just Epic. Definitely not a problem, just something to consider if you’ve got littles who will only eat chicken nuggets or Mac n cheese. 

We finished up dinner at about 5 minutes until 10;00, and walked outside to sit on the grass and watch the fountain show. It was SPECTACULAR and I definitely would recommend sticking around for it if you can! 

After the show we headed straight to the resort busses, and were expecting a crazy line, but to our surprise we walked right on, and we were back at Portofino within 30 minutes or so! 

Upon reflection, the only thing I would’ve done differently is skip BatM, if we had done that I think we could’ve done everything we really wanted to in one day without express passes. We probably could’ve ridden two rides in the time it took to ride that one. To really enjoy the parks, though, I think we could’ve benefitted from an extra day. If you’re not planning on spending the full 13 hours that the park is open, you will not get to do everything this park has to offer (and even then you will miss some things). We did the most in HP, then a little less in Nintendo, then even less in DU, then the least in Berk. Which is a bummer. But I think we made the most of it, and if your main plan is to enjoy the original three parks, and you just want to sample Epic while you’re there, it’s definitely doable! I’d estimate we did/saw about 65-70% of Epic universe, as someone with no context of how much we actually missed. 

Since we were here in October, there was no rain and the weather was pretty forgiving, about 80-85 degrees if I had to guess. A lot of people talk about the lack of shade/shelter, but it wasn’t super obvious to us since we didn’t need it. That will not be everyone’s experience though!

Overall, it was a great park and we will definitely be back. I don’t think I would stay at the Helios/Luna hotels yet, because none of them include express passes and you’d have to take a bus to all of the other parks. For our family, it is still much more worth it to stay in Portofino/hard rock/royal pacific, get the express passes and have the easy access to city walk, studios and islands. If you are a family who likes to have dinner at a full service restaurant, there are only two in Epic (that I could tell from the app) and no in-between/casual dining short of quick service, so you would have to take the bus just to get dinner at Antojitos/cowfish/etc. 

Until there is more on the Epic side, or those hotels include express passes for all four parks, I will continue to stay at the original resort properties. But I will definitely be back to Epic, if we can get 4-park parkhopper tickets then for more than one day, but if they stay separate, probably just one day again.

Despite the beauty I find in the ""you have no enemies"" philosophy - which even has transcended entertainment and fiction for me and became really important during a tough period of my own life, I can't help but feel Thors ultimately failed in his duties.  

As a father, his greatest duty was to protect his son, who he birthed into the world.  Instead his pacifism put him in danger of death.  Then ironically, by a stroke of ""luck"" Thorfinn was spared but in the process became a killing machine himself.  So Thors not only directly led to the torment and misery of his own son, but also indirectly led to countless more deaths by his son's hands.

Is this meant to be a criticism of the limitations of pacifism?  It kind of undercuts Thorfinn's message in season 2.  "
1oa14ir,aotearoa,Fred Hollows Foundation launched in New Zealand: 19 October 1992,BertOfAotearoa,2025-10-18T22:32:45,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aotearoa/comments/1oa14ir/fred_hollows_foundation_launched_in_new_zealand/,"[Fred Hollows \(National Library of Australia, nla.pic.an22839744-v\)](https://preview.redd.it/n91a3jwfbluf1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=76e432966d85060ca78ccebc99dcd96e049b2e4e)

The foundation was established in Australia by the Kiwi-born ophthalmologist (eye doctor) to treat eye problems in poorer countries. Within six years, 200,000 people had their sight restored via cataract surgery.

When he moved to Australia in 1965, Fred Hollows was shocked by the number of Aboriginal people with preventable eye disorders. Reducing the gap between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ turned into a lifelong passion that would see him become a champion of eye care in the developing world.

The task began in remote Australian communities, where the ‘intellectual with the wharfie’s manner’ soon became a local folk hero. After helping set up the first Aboriginal medical centre and a National Trachoma and Eye Health Programme, he went on to develop blindness prevention programmes in Asia, Africa and South America. The aim was always self-sufficiency – giving local communities the skills and facilities they needed to provide their own eye care.

As he battled terminal cancer, Fred Hollows and his supporters set up the Fred Hollows Foundation to make sure his cause would live on. Originally launched in Australia, the Foundation soon spread to New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

The Fred Hollows Foundation New Zealand works in the Pacific region. Its achievements include eye-health programmes in Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste, and a ‘Pacific Eye Institute’ in Suva, Fiji, that trains eye doctors and nurses and supplies them with equipment to take back to their home countries.

Worldwide, the Fred Hollows Foundation is active in more than 20 countries. Well over a million people have had their sight restored as a result of Fred Hollows’ life’s work.

1oa135y,aotearoa,Niue achieves self-government: 19 October 1974,BertOfAotearoa,2025-10-18T22:31:15,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aotearoa/comments/1oa135y/niue_achieves_selfgovernment_19_october_1974/,"[Issued twenty cent Niue 'Self Government 1974' stamp. \(PH002937, Te Papa\)](https://preview.redd.it/c5ig7jy2bluf1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bbdfd6aa89005ae48b623d1d13b67234293dc43)

The elevated rocky island, located in the South Pacific between Cook Islands and Tonga, had become a British protectorate in 1900 and then been annexed by New Zealand in 1901, along with Cook Islands.

Niue was subsequently administered by a resident commissioner appointed by the New Zealand government. Niue and Cook Islands were offered autonomy by New Zealand in 1965, but only the latter accepted at the time. In September 1974, 64% of resident Niueans voted in favour of the island becoming self-governing in free association with New Zealand.

The Niue Constitution Act came into force on 19 October 1974. New Zealand retained responsibility for Niue’s defence, and Niue had no military forces of its own. Niue was expected to have ‘shared values’ with New Zealand, from which it would receive ongoing financial support. 

Niue’s constitution recognised the authority of ‘Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand’. Niue remained part of the ‘Realm of New Zealand’. Robert Rex was elected as Niue’s first premier by the Niue Assembly and remained in office until his death in 1992.

Niueans continued to be New Zealand citizens and use New Zealand passports. Niueans who met normal residence criteria in either country could vote or stand in that country’s elections. Niue continued to use New Zealand currency, but issued its own postage stamps.

New Zealand cannot legislate for Niue, which has some ability to act as a sovereign state, for example by signing United Nations treaties and joining UN bodies and the Pacific Islands Forum. Like Cook Islands, Niue has not applied to join the UN itself. New Zealand considers that such a move could lead to the loss of Niueans’ automatic right to New Zealand citizenship. Niue has established its own nationality and immigration regimes.

| Remember when it seemed like the League was promoting Bustos like he was some sort of Canadian Messi? And Pacific rode those coat tails too. Non Pacific fans (okay me) were pretty irritated by the whole thing. It only made it worse that 2021 Pacific was no joke, with a roster that seemed to back it all up. But the fall from grace hasn't been kind. Smart managers make smart offers to good players. And Pacific FC management should have paid close attention... Meanwhile, Valour is the that team that just never seemed to get it together. For a brief moment in 2021(?) they looked like they were about to become some a team that rivalled Forge or Cavalry... But then Jean-Baptiste was injured, Ricci likely let his ego take over and it all came crashing down. These teams are just fighting for some sort of respect right now. Both may be fighting to be around next season. |

1oa10cu,ireland,Whining about militarism with no understanding or solution is just stereotypical of Irish politics. Some perspective about it from a tired Polish guy living here.,dominikobora,2025-10-18T22:28:21,317,335,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1oa10cu/whining_about_militarism_with_no_understanding_or/,"***TLDR***: Eastern European ""militarism"" is driven by *fear* \+ *uncertainty* ( largely due to Western passiveness). Denouncing militarism does nothing when you do not understand the emotions and history that lead to high military spending.

If you feel it is too long then the TLDR and part 2 is enough for the basics.

EE = Eastern Europe, WE = Western Europe. Sometimes I use West/Ireland interchangeably, my point is more so discussion about the attitudes and not just commentary of present reality. Sorry that its a rant.

/

I am writing this in light of Connolly's remarks but it really is more about the attitude in general. We are just so disengaged here. For context I'm Polish living here for a looong time.

I have seen people say that EE could “handle” a threat from Russia on their own. Some even argue that this means Western Europe doesn’t need to invest seriously in defense, as the East can take responsibility. EE nations spend heavily on military and some have conscription. I don't expect WE to do everything but just for responsibility to be fairly shared instead of seeing disengagement.

In EE, defense is largely seen from fear and uncertainty. We have faced genocide, occupation and foreign imposed regimes. People desire safety/certainty. Our sense of safety relies on multi-laterism, in the 90s/2000s it was baltics and V4. Today it has broadened to EU/NATO. Many in WE believe NATO/EU membership alone guarantees safety, but they often avoid doing their share so we rely on our old allies instead.

“Never again” has deep meaning in Poland not just referring to the Holocaust, but also to foreign occupation and imposed regimes. Peace must be worked for, not assumed. In 1970 Giedroyc doctrine was written by a dissident abroad. It called for keeping the borders as they are and for deep multi-lateral co-operation. Motivated by a potential threat from Russia. We fixed really bad relations with Lithuania (Poland occupied 1/3rd of Lithuania between WW1-WW2 due to a significant Polish minority). We tried our best to have good relations with all our neighbors.The West often ignored EE and went over our heads to negotiate with Russia directly ( Prime example being Merkels ""ost-politik"". More like ""Russland politik"").

We joined EU + NATO alongside neighbors/friends. A extension of multi-laterism, not an end goal nor were we dragged in.

People do not know the complexities of why EE feels how it does. In 1881-83 Poland lived under martial law. People were terrifed that the Soviet army was going to cross the border and begin massacring people like in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Communism fell before the Berlin wall. Gorbachev said that the Soviet army would not intervene in Warsaw pact states. Then the Polish regime began collapsing and we had semi-free elections before the Berlin wall even fell. The old regime was sustained by violence alone. And today we face threats of violence from Russia today but we see the west not doing enough so we prepare ourselves.

Distrust shapes us. Communism merely froze old ethnic and border conflicts that resurfaced in 1990 that required real work to fix. The old feeling of abandonment towards the allies from WW2 was added to instead of being addressed. Our biggest economic partner now is Germany but we trust them little and not just for WW2. In 1990 Helmut Kohl was very vague about his opinion of the modern Polish-German border, to appeal to right wing voters who wanted former German land back. He changed his opinion after being bollocksed by the US. Other German politicans said even worse things.

Germans had been deported to make space for Polish people deported from Belarus/Ukraine. It simply is too late to fix, and would start a chain reaction of conflicts. We feel we cannot rely on Germany alone without France/UK/USA. More broadly we feel that while we do enough, WE does not do enough both diplomatically/rhetorically and militarily. Leading to us not having trust in others and instead only in ourselves.

Japan can afford near-demilitarization. South Korea cannot. Similarly UK/USA could choose to demilitarize and be isolationist but Poland or the Baltics cannot. And Ireland is already practically demilitarized.

A new thing in WE that people feel is that America has left us due to isolationism. Meanwhile EE has felt this towards WE to varying extents for a long time.

/

WE confuses neutrality/isolationism/pacifism as one thing. Ireland is apparently “neutral”, yet the EU’s mutual defense clause is more binding than NATO’s Article 5. A tax haven that spends almost nothing on the army, why should others bother?

Moreover, a more engaged Ireland doesn’t mean expanding land forces. Expand the coast guard, buy maritime patrol aircraft/helicopters. We shouldn't be relying on the UK so much. Likewise our economic reliance on US multinationals is too much, we see Martin has been awfully nice to Trump. We cannot say we are neutral when rely on the UK/US so much.

/

Similarly people confuse militarism/aggressiveness/deterrence.

Simple militarism like the target of 5% ( Actually 3.5% with a new 1.5% category for things like military pensions) is counterproductive. I want fair spending, not equal. Spain can't sit at 2% vs Polish 5%. A large portion of Spains 2% is just spent on wages. 2% on equipment alone would be much better. The deterrence value gained from spending is not linear and WE is very cost-inefficient (imagine n shaped graph) in terms of deterrence. A massive amount of Western budgets goes to wages meanwhile

Poland is on the other extreme spending huge amounts ( eg multiple types of tanks from multiple countries to get tanks ASAP). We would spend less overall by organizing spending by coming together as a whole or in groups instead of spending inefficiently as we do now. Importantly everyone being involved means more oversight from inside while still being able to deter outside.

Polish society partly accepts high defense spending because the country was poor as shite as early as the 2000s. Meanwhile WE has been spoiled by recent history. And the ironic part is that Polish infrastructure and even somewhat the public healthcare system is better then here. I recently had to a pay a lot for something that the HSE does not cover but is covered in Poland ( with long wait times).

Yes Poland is taking on debt but we run a surplus while the country is in shambles while simultaneously being reliant on the UK/USA.

/

Ironically the western left is enabling the Polish right wing. The Polish left wing is by far the most militaristic in terms of spending but the least militaristic in terms of international relations. The Polish left wing project has been integration with other countries while having a big army to deter Russia from our area. The Polish right wing does not give a damn about our friends and is willing to save money even if means abandoning others. As a response to people being scared the left spends more, the right wing just tells people not to worry because those foreigners don't matter.

High military spending in EE is deterrence because of fear and uncertainty. Not by aggression or xenophobia. The Polish right points to the WE left to say that spending money on defense is pointless because Poland has to disproportionality pay to maintain a European peace/rules ( which they do not care for anyway ). Essentially it just fuels euro-skepticism

What we see is Europe that does understand nor does it want to understand EE from a EE perspective. We see lefists harp on about NATO/USA bad. So what? EE has big concerns about a specific topic and all we hear is that the whole thing is/was rotten. Are you surprised that we spend so much on the military in such a context?

/

People import a American view rather then a Polish view. Eg many people import a American view of the military-industrial complex without recognizing that things are on average different here.

PGZ is the 64th largest arms company in the world ( [https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/fs\_2412\_top\_100\_2023\_0.pdf](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/fs_2412_top_100_2023_0.pdf) ).

PGZ is owned fully by the Polish state. Norways and Finlands have their own big military companies that are nationalized. Patria for Finland, Kongsberg Gruppen for Norway.

This should be a opportunity to develop nationalized defense industry that serve many European countries to remove the profit motive in part or in whole. Military spending ends up in private Americans pockets because Europe does not have an autonomous defense industry. Germany/France/UK try but arguments and bureaucracy impede them. The problem is that European security structure barely exist and European defense suffers from a lack of unity. We desperately need to do it ourselves to fix problems like profiteering + un-equitable burden but also to lessen our reliance on a few countries like the USA.

Poland is not innocent eithier, we bought Russian gas while complaining about Nordstream because it avoided transit fees. Polish politicans bring up reparations from Germany to rile people up. Polish foreign policy has often also been US-centric. Our previous government were obstructionists in the EU. And very often Poland complains without proposing any solutions.

/

***Part 2:*** How it bites us in the arse at home.

We see that the Irish government has done absolutely nothing to prepare for NI reunifying. No clarity for topics like devolved parliament, representation of British identifying people, policing, integration of systems like NI's NHS and international involvement from the EU/UN/UK.

We are so stuck in ""it is how it is"" mindset without ever thinking about fixing it.

If I was in NI then I would be voting for Alliance because I rather elect people who want to get shit done instead of demagoguery about the constitutional status.

We suffer from the passive naivety of believing that it will be solved when it happens. But one of the biggest obstacles to it happening is us doing nothing.

That is all for this part, stating how I see it vs comparing is a lot shorter. But both issues ultimately stem from being naive and passive.

I am intentionally limiting myself to a very narrow view. I could go on about Ukraine but I find that does little but make it too long. If anyone has any particular questions then fire them out, I might take a while to answer but I'll try to answer everything.

Sorry for formatting, pasting this over from a .txt. And sorry if it might feel disjointed, this took me ages to write and refine.

PS: how about a ""Moaning Michał"" tag for Polish people complaining."

1oa0fbz,Broadway,Musical for 16 year old Girl from the Pacific NW,Salty_Cartographer84,2025-10-18T22:04:31,0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1oa0fbz/musical_for_16_year_old_girl_from_the_pacific_nw/,"My daughter and I will have an opportunity to see one show while we are in NY in two weeks.  She previously saw Hadestown and (sorry?) did not love it.  She had a difficult time following the storyline as she didn't know it beforehand.  We have seen Wicked with a traveling company (absolutely loved) so I'd like to see something else.  We were suggested to see The Outsiders but she didn't love the book so she's not inclined for that.  I keep pouring over all the wonderful options and just can't make a decision.  If you have a daughter of similar age that has seen and loved one of the current shows, would you be willing to share?  Thank you so much.

\*\*Edited to add, we wanted to see Hamilton but the prices are way above our budget.

  
\*\*\*Edited: She's 16 with three older brothers.  She's familiar with language and raunchy doesn't intimidate either of us.  :/"

1oa090o,YourOriginalCharacter,My lore for Dewey and Bishop and also their world.,Salty-Reference7651,2025-10-18T21:57:20,5,4,https://i.redd.it/31k866ytzvvf1.jpeg,"OK I used to have a lore wrote out for them but to my old account was deleted. So here's their lore again.

Bishop Walker (code name Treeman) is a member of a group called Crypted Hunter a organization that main job is to hunter and capture cryptids to protect the world.  Bishop trained his way to become a one of the best at his job.  Although he is still merely a Officer he is not one of the highest members which is a commander.  He primarily specializes in a stealth and long range combat with some hand to hand on the side.  Here where's a suit that is mentor to mimic a smaller trees which helps him blend in and makes it so cryptid's who contracts and have a hard time getting him.  He has a modified shotgun that has a longer Range to it but not as powerful.  But he can make up for this with his special ability.  Bishop is a known as a spellbinder which are people who have the ability to give things power by writing glyphs on various objects and creatures.  He has a glyph that is able to put pure power into a object at the risk of destroying it due to the mass amount of power.  Of course he has no problem with this as he simply puts the glyph on his ammo box it empowers the bullets inside the box so when he fires it they shoot out with massive amounts of force being able to shred more than a typical bullet can.  Although his ammo boxer will sometimes, Put it although this is a better alternative than marking each of the bullets with the symbol as the more durable the object the longer they can last.  Plus he actually has to carve the symbol on it and doing that for every single bullet would get very tiring.  He's a very quieter man that can come off as being too serious or even rude to a lot of people.  Here's a kind person but he takes his job very seriously.  He not only thinks that cryptids are dangerous for people but also to the environment seeing them as abominations to the natural order.  He loves nature especially the various plants.  He also likes more vegetarian options and has a liking for bitter foods.  He does not like alcohol he mostly drinks tea which is how him and Dewey managed to get along despite their differences.

Dewey Sherbet (code name Wildman) Is also a member of the crypted hunters and is a junior officer the rank below officer.  Dewey is a Cursed One A group of people who are born with various powers at birth that often times mutate or change their bodies to look more monstrous.  Oftentimes these powers will be a more flexible and vary than with a spellbinders, Along with needing no symbols to write.  They oftentimes are more physically stronger than spellbinders.  Although one can also be a cursed one while also being a spellbinder. Although cursed ones are often treated worst and are not technically accepted into society and are basically forced to either be hunted like encrypted or join the crypted hunters. When Dewey was young There was nothing strange about him until his curse came into effect he started growing a bigger and had a lot more hair.  Well at first this seems like an advantage his appearance made him look like a common type of crypted a Sasquatch.  This caused the village and his own parents to chase him out in fear of him.  He survived mostly in the wild forging and killing animals to survive.  Until he was eventually captured by the crypted hunters.  They realized he was not a Sasquatch due to his more human like face, So they got to training and teaching him to become a crypted hunter.  Here is very powerful not just physically but also due to his unique power.  Here can transform his fur Into any kind of the 4 states of matter.  Solid liquid gasses and plasma.  This allows him to be versatile with a lot of his abilities and fighting.  He can even absorb similar elements into his transformed fur to make it even bigger like Having his fur in a water state go into a puddle and absorbing the water to become bigger.  Due to his good behavior and kind attitude he was able to become a junior officer surprisingly quickly, Although this was to the dismay of a bishop who did not really connect with the Dewey at first due to his more louder and talkative attitude.  Although they quickly gained a respecter for one another on and off of the field.  They are greater as a team complementing each other very well.  Although not everything is fine with Dewey.  He still has this urge from when he was out in the woods for so long, This primordial animalistic urge to hunt and kill to become a beast, He pushes this urge all the way down he does not want to become the monster everyone always saw him as.  He's not going to be good because of his powers.  He is going to be good despite his powers.

Anyways for the extra lore that I could not fit in.  So how did this world come to be?  Well there are two planets in two different universes.  One was more closer in resemblance to Earth but the more old West style with its technology and culture.  The other was a brighter luscious planet with a forest and oceans but also skies that looked like an aurora borealis and a massive crystals that littered the land growing high as mountains or even growing on mountains, Looking like a coral reef.  On this earth people lived in harmony with the world and its various unique creatures.  Despite these people having various different cultures they were all connected so they were commonly referred to as the Mcclon and the beast who inhabited these lands were known as the Accoun.  There was something interesting about the various crystals that scattered their land.  they had this power innate to them.  None of the Mcclon or Accoun bothered to take their power and simply built their homes around them seeing them as sanctuaries.  But these crystals had a unique energy that could sometimes riff the hole between these two dimensions.  Enough of these happened that a small group of the government saw these portals. They could not travel through these portals due to their small size and the fact that they would quickly blink out of existence. But they were so interested in these that they started collecting them.  After collecting a few of these and also losing a few arms due to the portals suddenly closing, They were able to gain enough of them to test their abilities.  They figured that with enough of them they could make a more stable riff that they would be able to travel through.  Using Had their technology they managed to build a device using these crystals to try and travel to this dimension.  But something went wrong and instead of creating a stable portal a massive calamity occurred that both destroyed the second world and Brought multiple of the Mcclon and Accoun's to theirs.  Now this was not the plan you see something else tampered with this a being older than time older than existence a elder God who wanted to destroy everything in return everything back to the silence that it's so wanted.  Because of the mass of crystals that were being used for the machine the God was able to tamper with it causing the calamity.  It did this because for many years it tried to destroy everything thing would but the various Accoun's always stop them from being able to materialize in a their plane of existence which would destroy everything.  But now with their species home gone and them divided he could now start his plans.  Also I didn't mention this because I had no way to put this cryptids are busted as all get out.  Like they work on werewolf logic which is basically unless you have this one thing they are basically unkillable.  Which is surprisingly not an accurate if you read a lot of cryptid legends.  So yeah that's how they're able to fend off an elder god.  Anyway but anyways after the calamity the Accoun and Mcclon were scattered some of them even being lost and the calamity, Having their essences being ripped apart and spread around.  The Mcclon that got caught in this would become spirit vengeful and would attack or haunt in the human from this world.  While the Accoun ended up having their powers being filtered into various individuals giving them powers similar to what they have.  Why this is how we get curse ones.  The ones who did were scattered but one thing was clear to the Accoun this Earth was to blame.  A lot of the Accoun had powers that could smell a sort of scent a aura around people that can tell them various things.  And one thing was clear these were not their people and they reeked of a sin that not even a their people were where.  Mini Accoun attacked the people of this earth whether it be a blaming them for what happened or out of a mindless blood loss for revenge.  Not all of them did but a lot of them went and collected each other into groups swearing revenge to take down their government and make them pay for destroying their home and for a torturing their people.  Oh I forgot that you see the Mcclon were technically a lot easier for them to integrate into their society being the fact that they looked just like humans.  But the government of the nation that did the experiment notice that these people were not like others having different memories and different languages to them.  So they began to collect these people and get information out of them.  The detail of course after managing to communicate with them and also some of the Accoun's they realize What they did and to make sure that it never got out to the public they began to issue arrest warrants and even bounties for the Mcclon to make sure that they would not pay for their crime.  I should also make this clear this was the action of one nation there are multiple nations on this earth and most of them are not aware of this.  This is mostly because Of this government basically running a giant propaganda campaign as well as being more friendly and willing to do trade with these other countries in exchange for helping them with their crypted problems.  Although there are some countries that are more in the loop than others some that realize that something isn't right and there have been small organizations that have been trying to stop this government.  Even working with the Accoun and Mcclon.  Oh also the Accoun and the Mcclon got new names eh that were given eh by the people of this earth the Accoun were called cryptids and the Mcclon were called Pestilent bringers. Pestilent bringers in Pacifically were branded as mostly people with a disease that needed to be contained and capture which is what the government says to explain why they were hunting these people down.  Although they also tinted to use other methods like That tended to a leader to a racial stereotypes of these plague Bringers that unfortunately tended to spread to the rest of the various races that lived on this earth.  A government using Racism to justify killing and containing people man I wonder what that's like?  But besides the timely political commentary.  The elder God got what he wanted A lot of the cryptids were now focused on the people of this planet and not him and even a lot of the more powerful ones were in this sort of coma having their giant bodies being laid underground or deep in the oceans.  He could now slowly bring his presence into this world by Giving people these visions of the symbols that when are drawn give power.  Smaller slowly more and more people he would give this power to eventually in fact the entire planet and be able to bring him to their world.  This is the origin of the spellbinders.

So yeah that was a lot there's probably some spelling errors in there but either way I hope you enjoyed this massive amount of lore."

1o9zv1g,sabaton,And Now For Something Completely Different - Similar Stories Part XCVIII,TheRealZejfi,2025-10-18T21:41:27,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sabaton/comments/1o9zv1g/and_now_for_something_completely_different/,"The new album has dropped, so it's time for another discussion about the topics of the songs!

We start with Templars.

Do you know some interesting stories about the Crusades? Monastic orders? The Templars themselves? Or about some secret associations?

I'll start:

1. As you probably know, Philip the Fair accused Templars of many things, including worship of Baphomet. The demon in question doesn't appear in any source of any belief system that has demons in it. He was completely made up by the king. What is interesting, I stumbled upon two theories where his name comes from. The first one claims it's a misheard and mistranscribed name Muhammad. The other claims the Templars used code in their correspondence, and 'baphomet' was a word for 'wisdom'.

2. You all heard about the Illuminati, right? The mysterious cabal controlling every aspect of our lives. But do you know where they come from? The real-life Illuminati were an 18th-century association whose goal was to fight against superstition, obscurantism, Church influence, and monarchical authoritarianism. Because of the last thing, they were disbanded by Charles Theodore Wittelsbach, Elector of Bavaria. But the modern idea of Illuminati as the omniscient secret cabal comes from a surprising place: a book series called ""The Illuminatus! Trilogy"", written by Robert Shea and Robert Wilson, former ""Playboy"" writers. Yup, you read it right. The Illuminati conspiracy was invented by guys writing for a magazine with not-so-clothed ladies.

I might have to travel from Germany to the Pacific North West at the end of December. With transfers and flight time, it's over 24h of traveling.

I got surgery on the last week of September, so I will be 3 months post-op. Do you think it's too ambitious to plan such a long trip at this point in recovery? I've been recovering very well, but I've heard plane rides are pretty horrible after hysto, and I definitely don't want to have a medical issue while in the US. Does anyone have experience traveling during recovery?

1o9z5t7,Paranormal,The Story of the Cloud Deer -- My personal Favorite Encounter I've Ever Had,Honey-Badger-90,2025-10-18T21:13:23,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1o9z5t7/the_story_of_the_cloud_deer_my_personal_favorite/,"If you're familiar with Ley Lines, the house this took place in was directly over one, so there were a lot of entities that came and went on a regular basis with LOTS of activity happening pretty much nightly. It was a fantastic location to do paranormal investigations, because you'd almost always get something you couldn't debunk. This was also the house I grew up in.

As a little background as to why the coming story is going to be as detailed of an encounter as it is, I'm a Psychic Medium, a studied Medicine Woman, and a Professional Paranormal Investigator. Also TWing this story because I will explain how this man passed away, and it may be disturbing to some people.

One night many years ago, in the apartment on the property that I lived in, I was sitting at my desk talking to a friend of mine. He and I both noticed that on my camera, there was a weird glow coming from the side of my video image. We stopped, and I looked off to the side to see a man standing there. He didn't seem malicious, but he was injured.

Half of his jaw was missing, his face mangled and scarred on that side with the eye permanently closed. He only had one ear. His hair was white, he was extremely skinny, and he wore a stained linen shirt over a pair of light brown slacks. He was barefoot. He was also very clearly First Nations, but not one I recognized.

I asked him his name. He said something I didn't understand. I asked him why he was there. He says ""Cloud Deer."" Is that your name? He shakes his head. ""Cloud Deer"" and pointed outside. ""Is Cloud Deer with you?"" No. Then what are Cloud Deer? He smiles.

He then proceeds to tell me piece by piece this story that I had to glue together to make sense of it. I won't go through that process because it took nearly two hours to gather everything, writing information down onto a notepad, and with the help of my friend on the video call, making sense of WHAT this guy was trying to tell us.

Here's the story in the context it was meant to be in:

Our friend, his son, and his son's friend had been asked to go hunt. They were tracking a deer through the woods when they lost the trail. Friend decided that the best thing to do was to scout the mountainside individually to pick up the trail. Friend took the low ground while the two younger men went high.

He ends up in a very green field that wasn't there before. He remembered it was all woods the last time he was there, so he was pretty confused. In this field, he found deer that were all white and made of the sky. They grazed like deer, were cautious like deer, but he'd never seen anything like it. However, they DID look edible, and he knew no one would believe him if he just took the tale back home. He didn't even believe his own eyes.

He raised his bow and fired an arrow into the eye of one of these deer. As he walked forward to go collect it, all of the other deer running for cover, he called for his son and the other young man. Shortly after, he looked up and he saw the Sun straight ahead. This was odd, because he was in a wooded valley. You can't see the sun from that level.

Then there was pain. He couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't speak, and could barely breathe. He just remembered hitting the ground. The next thing he personally remembered was him waking up in a loud wooden building that moved, his son sat next to him, and they were both in chains. His son spoke kind, reassuring words to him, but all he could hear around him was crying, coughing, and confusion. He passed shortly after that.

Now... You may wonder what the heck he saw and what happened to him if you haven't already figured it out.

This guy ran across a frontiersman's flock of sheep, and the frontiersman shot him in the jaw for killing one of them. Friend had never seen a sheep before, so he didn't know they belonged to someone. He had also never seen a gun or what it looks like when one is fired. He succumbed to his wounds while his people were being shipped out by train.

The man was Miwuk, which is a small Tribe on the Northern California/Southern Oregon Pacific Coast. After I agreed to tell his story as often as I could, he smiled, he danced, and he crossed over. He couldn't move on until he told his story because he never could in life. He wanted someone to believe him.

I tell this story frequently to keep my promise I made to him. I don't tell the story to be funny, to mock him, or to shame him. I tell it because he waited a little over 200 years to tell it to someone who would listen. Now it's Reddit's turn to know."

1o9ya07,ldspolitics,The meaningless Trump moment that said it all,zarnt,2025-10-18T20:38:18,3,0,https://youtu.be/zTDFhWWPZ4Q?si=1zyVp9fwPIX6P63s&t=2009,"A few weeks ago Trump announced his [intention](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115272539858157742) to uncover the mystery of what happened to Amelia Earhart.

>I have been asked by many people about the life and times of Amelia Earhart...She disappeared in the South Pacific while trying to become the first woman to fly around the World. Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again. Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions. I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart, her final trip, and everything else about her...

But the truth is we already know what happened. She and her navigator almost certainly ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Howland Island. She didn't disappear ""without notice"". There were several failures in planning and communication that led to an untimely demise. Earhart didn't know enough about her radio equipment. The commander of the Navy vessel she was communicating with had the expertise that would have saved Earhart but didn't want the responsibility. The truth is tragic but it's not a mystery.

Watch the linked video and you'll know more about what happened to Amelia Earhart than the average person. It's free and and requires no security clearance.

That brings us back to Trump. He promises big things. Only he can do it. You depend on the strongman for the truth. The world is full of plot twists and intrigue. If it's [boring](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-mike-waltz-tariffs-immigration-arizona-grijalva-live-updates-rcna218470) it's probably not true. At least that's what he would tell you.

When the final analysis of Trump is written this little promise might not even make it as a footnote. It doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things that Trump promised new knowledge on something that is already entirely knowable and about which experts have said there is nothing to declassify.

But the story of Amelia Earhart carries a lesson. The conclusion at 33:30 of this video is why I made this post. It's an important message.

>When attempting any challenging endeavor you need someone with the right knowledge who will also take responsibility for getting things right. That's what you need to battle the inherent chaos and disorder of the universe. Otherwise, what you get is disaster.

We're living through one such disaster right now."

Niche, designer, dupes, & hyped stuff (decant)",Shinfo73,2025-10-18T20:25:48,8,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceswap/comments/1o9xyn4/wts_decanting_personal_collection_now_with/,"**As of this month, my decants are now all pressurized/glass bottles with high quality atomizers. Prices do NOT increase either! ;)** More 3ml pressurized bottles arrive this week.

I'm not a full time decanter, I just like to post some of the collection up for grabs every now and then. I try to list prices as low as possible as this is just a hobby for me & a fun way to share scents, talk shop with y'all. I generally buy stuff I enjoy but if you're searching for something specific that's not on my list, let me know and maybe I can maybe pick it up.

If you are a fellow decanter, I'm usually open to decant trades. LMK! :)

1o9wsdh,skibiditoilet,A collaboration/crossover between EDF (Earth Defense Force) and Skibidi Toilet would be really cool to see,OkWall8046,2025-10-18T19:38:11,7,1,https://i.redd.it/e2tmz9aelvvf1.jpeg,"The two are quite similar:  
Both series have a earth based faction (The Alliance and EDF) that is trying to defend the planet from a invading alien faction in a ever-escalating conflict that progressively gets more crazier and intense. Seeing the Alliance and the EDF band together and unite to protect Earth. While the Astro Empire and the Ravagers, two alien factions battle against each other to vary control over the planet. Their battle causing devastation and destruction in their wake across the globe.

To give some elaboration on *what* E.D.F (Earth Defense Force) is for those who may not know it.  
EDF aka Earth Defense Force is a third person game series that's about a planetary conflict between a alien faction called the Ravagers, who want to invade Earth, against the *only* military organization on earth that is capable of defending the planet called the EDF.

# First:

We shall discuss the EDF: aka Earth Defense Force: To put it simple, they're the Alliance if we are to compare it to Skibidi Toilet, but composed entirely of humans. But don't underestimate 'em, because unlike the humans in Skibidi Toilet. Not only is the EDF capable of fighting alien threats, they're also quite significantly *psychotic* with some of the things they're willing to fight despite still being humans. The EDF have assortment of weapons, vehicles, and technology they use against the alien threat they face. But for the sake of length; we shall explore the four main classes you'll often play as in the EDF games:

**Rangers**: They're your basic class/grunts. So in comparison, they're like the basic Cameraman in Skibidi Toilet. While they don't anything flashy or cool tricks. The Rangers have one in in spades... and that is absolute **firepower.** Talking about missiles, energy based weapons, literal ***nukes***. They simplicity makes it up for having absolute weapons of mass destruction, perfect for annihilating aliens.

**Fencers: (***My personal favorite class)* Fencers are the equivalent of the large characters in Skibidi Toilet. Who wear power armor like the ones in Fallout. They're heavy, slow, and not quite maneuverable, But they make it up for being literal war-machines. These fellas tend to carry the big guns, the kind that Rangers wouldn't be able to lift. Fencers are also able to utilize two sets of weapons. They even have melee options with anime-esque large swords and hammers, with shields that straight up reflect projectiles.

**Wing Divers:** For the Wing Divers. To put it simply. Imagine Plungerwoman but mass produced, but equipped with some of the most advanced weaponry the EDF have to offer. They're the quickest and the most maneuverable of the class, with the ability to fly, but have a heat meter whenever they use their equipment too much, and are incredibly vulnerable if they get hit.

**Air Raiders:** They're similar to the Rangers. But more support orientated. But not to worry because out of the four classes. Air Raiders have the *good* toys. From literal missile strikes, orbital lasers, bombardments, ***nukes***. Air Raiders are the god of war and *can* annihilate and decimate battlegrounds. *Not only that*. They also able to deploy vehicles, from your standard tanks, helicopters, to *straight up mechs.* Have you *ever* wondered what it would be like to pilot a jeager from pacific rim? Air Raiders have the means to fulfill that fantasy.

I would like to yap more, and bring some attention to the Ravagers but this already has become increasingly long. But to point it sort. The Ravagers are some of the craziest alien faction you'll encounter. I am talking straight up ***GIANT. BUGS.*** To giant robots, to giant space ships and motherships, the whole yards!"

My average rating on the PCGS set is 64.5 (all are MS 64 - 67). What are your thoughts on converting all to PCGS? I assume the cleaned ones will have a negative impact on the set’s rating?
